    The USD description has to be either a path (file name or URL), or an existing USD stage instance that implements the `Stage <https://openusd.org/dev/api/class_usd_stage.html>`_ interface.

    See :ref:`usd_parsing` for more information.

    Args:
        builder: The :class:`ModelBuilder` to add the bodies and joints to.
        source: The file path to the USD file, or an existing USD stage instance.
        xform: The transform to apply to the entire scene.
        override_root_xform: If ``True``, the articulation root's world-space
            transform is replaced by ``xform`` instead of being composed with it,
            preserving only the internal structure (relative body positions). Useful
            for cloning articulations at explicit positions. Not intended for sources
            containing multiple articulations, as all roots would be placed at the
            same ``xform``. Defaults to ``False``.
        floating: Controls the base joint type for the root body (bodies not connected as
            a child to any joint).

            - ``None`` (default): Uses format-specific default (creates a FREE joint for USD bodies without joints).
            - ``True``: Creates a FREE joint with 6 DOF (3 translation + 3 rotation). Only valid when
              ``parent_body == -1`` since FREE joints must connect to world frame.
            - ``False``: Creates a FIXED joint (0 DOF).

            Cannot be specified together with ``base_joint``.
        base_joint: Custom joint specification for connecting the root body to the world
            (or to ``parent_body`` if specified). This parameter enables hierarchical composition with
            custom mobility. Dictionary with joint parameters as accepted by
            :meth:`ModelBuilder.add_joint` (e.g., joint type, axes, limits, stiffness).

            Cannot be specified together with ``floating``.
        parent_body: Parent body index for hierarchical composition. If specified, attaches the
            imported root body to this existing body, making them part of the same kinematic articulation.
            The connection type is determined by ``floating`` or ``base_joint``. If ``-1`` (default),
            the root connects to the world frame. **Restriction**: Only the most recently added
            articulation can be used as parent; attempting to attach to an older articulation will raise
            a ``ValueError``.

        only_load_enabled_rigid_bodies: If True, only rigid bodies which do not have `physics:rigidBodyEnabled` set to False are loaded.
        only_load_enabled_joints: If True, only joints which do not have `physics:jointEnabled` set to False are loaded.
        joint_drive_gains_scaling: The default scaling of the PD control gains (stiffness and damping), if not set in the PhysicsScene with as "newton:joint_drive_gains_scaling".
        verbose: If True, print additional information about the parsed USD file. Default is False.
        ignore_paths: A list of regular expressions matching prim paths to ignore.
        collapse_fixed_joints: If True, fixed joints are removed and the respective bodies are merged. Only considered if not set on the PhysicsScene as "newton:collapse_fixed_joints".
        enable_self_collisions: Default for whether self-collisions are enabled for all shapes within an articulation. Resolved via the schema resolver from ``newton:selfCollisionEnabled`` (NewtonArticulationRootAPI) or ``physxArticulation:enabledSelfCollisions``; if neither is authored, this value takes precedence.
        apply_up_axis_from_stage: If True, the up axis of the stage will be used to set :attr:`newton.ModelBuilder.up_axis`. Otherwise, the stage will be rotated such that its up axis aligns with the builder's up axis. Default is False.
        root_path: The USD path to import, defaults to "/".
        joint_ordering: The ordering of the joints in the simulation. Can be either "bfs" or "dfs" for breadth-first or depth-first search, or ``None`` to keep joints in the order in which they appear in the USD. Default is "dfs".
        bodies_follow_joint_ordering: If True, the bodies are added to the builder in the same order as the joints (parent then child body). Otherwise, bodies are added in the order they appear in the USD. Default is True.
        skip_mesh_approximation: If True, mesh approximation is skipped. Otherwise, meshes are approximated according to the ``physics:approximation`` attribute defined on the UsdPhysicsMeshCollisionAPI (if it is defined), using the settings from :attr:`~newton.ModelBuilder.default_mesh_approximation_cfg`. Default is False.
        load_sites: If True, sites (prims with ``NewtonSiteAPI`` or ``MjcSiteAPI``) are loaded as non-colliding reference points. If False, sites are ignored. Default is True.
        load_visual_shapes: If True, non-physics visual geometry is loaded. If False, visual-only shapes are ignored (sites are still controlled by ``load_sites``). Default is True.
        load_static_visual_shapes: If True, supported visual-only geometry outside
            rigid-body hierarchies is loaded as static shapes when
            ``load_visual_shapes`` is also True. Default is True.
        hide_collision_shapes: If True, collision shapes on bodies that already
            have visual-only geometry are hidden unconditionally, regardless of
            whether the collider has authored PBR material data. Default is False.
        force_show_colliders: If True, collision shapes get the VISIBLE flag
            regardless of whether visual shapes exist on the same body. Note that
            ``hide_collision_shapes=True`` still suppresses the VISIBLE flag for
            colliders on bodies with visual-only geometry. Default is False.
        parse_mujoco_options: Whether MuJoCo solver options from the PhysicsScene should be parsed. If False, solver options are not loaded and custom attributes retain their default values. Default is True.
        convert_mjc_equality_constraints: Whether MuJoCo equality schemas should be converted to Newton loop
            joints or mimic constraints while preserving MuJoCo equality metadata for SolverMuJoCo. If False,
            equality constraints are preserved in the ``mujoco:equality_constraint`` custom-attribute namespace
            and finalize under ``model.mujoco.equality_constraint_*``.
        mesh_maxhullvert: Maximum vertices for convex hull approximation of meshes. Note that an authored ``newton:maxHullVertices`` attribute on any shape with a ``NewtonMeshCollisionAPI`` will take priority over this value.
        schema_resolvers: Resolver instances in priority order. Default is to only parse Newton-specific attributes.
            Schema resolvers collect per-prim "solver-specific" attributes, see :ref:`schema_resolvers` for more information.
            These include namespaced attributes such as ``newton:*``, ``physx*``
            (e.g., ``physxScene:*``, ``physxRigidBody:*``, ``physxSDFMeshCollision:*``), and ``mjc:*`` that
            are authored in the USD but not strictly required to build the simulation. This is useful for
            inspection, experimentation, or custom pipelines that read these values via
            ``result["schema_attrs"]`` returned from ``parse_usd()``.

            .. experimental::

                The ``schema_resolvers`` argument may change without prior notice.
        force_position_velocity_actuation: If True and both stiffness (kp) and damping (kd)
            are non-zero, joints use :attr:`~newton.JointTargetMode.POSITION_VELOCITY` actuation mode.
            If False (default), actuator modes are inferred per joint via :func:`newton.JointTargetMode.from_gains`:
            :attr:`~newton.JointTargetMode.POSITION` if stiffness > 0, :attr:`~newton.JointTargetMode.VELOCITY` if only
            damping > 0, :attr:`~newton.JointTargetMode.EFFORT` if a drive is present but both gains are zero
            (direct torque control), or :attr:`~newton.JointTargetMode.NONE` if no drive/actuation is applied.
        legacy_margin_gap: If True, restore pre-MuJoCo-3.9 import behavior
            where ``shape_margin`` is computed as ``mjc_margin - mjc_gap``.
            Use for USD files authored against MuJoCo <= 3.8. Defaults to
            False (identity translation matching MuJoCo 3.9 semantics).

        return_deformable_results: If True, include the experimental deformable entries in the
            returned mapping (``path_cable_map`` / ``path_cloth_map`` / ``path_soft_map`` /
            ``path_attachment_map`` and the matching ``path_*_attrs``). Off by default, so the
            default return shape carries no deformable additions.

    Returns:
        .. experimental::

           ``return_deformable_results`` and its conditional result entries are experimental and
           may change or be removed without prior notice.

        When ``return_deformable_results=True``, imported deformable (cable/cloth/volume) element
        ranges are returned by prim path in the ``path_cable_map`` / ``path_cloth_map`` /
        ``path_soft_map`` entries below, and the material attributes as authored in the
        matching ``path_*_attrs`` entries. The map entries are build-time snapshots of the
        builder immediately after this call (already remapped when this call collapses fixed
        joints); they are not live selections, and a later ``replicate()``, ``add_builder()``,
        or other structural mutation is outside their contract. The ``path_*_attrs`` entries
        hold authored or resolved source values (``material`` as authored,
        ``resolved_density`` as used), while the map entries and ``joint_indices`` inside
        ``path_attachment_attrs`` are realized builder indices; ``unsupported_reason`` is
        diagnostic text, not a stable code, and a prim absent from a realized map may still
        appear in the authored metadata.

        ``path_particle_map`` is always returned. It maps each imported
        ``UsdGeom.Points`` prim carrying ``NewtonPointsDeformableSimAPI`` whose
        governing ``PhysicsDeformableBodyAPI`` resolves to a
        ``NewtonMPMSceneAPI`` owner to its half-open ``[start, end)`` builder
        particle range. These ranges are build-time snapshots and are not
        updated by later structural builder mutations.
        Each resolved whole-prim or point-``GeomSubset`` physics material must
        apply ``NewtonMPMMaterialAPI``, ``PhysicsMaterialAPI``, or
        ``PhysicsVolumeDeformableMaterialAPI``. MPM elasticity is read from
        ``newton:mpm:youngsModulus`` and ``newton:mpm:poissonsRatio``. After
        unit conversion, Young's modulus is in Pa and density is in kg/m^3.
        Unbound Points use Newton's registered material defaults and
        ``ModelBuilder.default_shape_cfg`` density. All Points imported by one
        call must resolve to the same MPM scene; unrelated PhysicsScenes
        and particle systems are ignored. ``particle_scene_path`` contains the
        governing ``UsdPhysics.Scene`` prim path, or ``None`` when no particles
        are imported.

        Particle widths are diameters. Newton converts each radius as
        ``width / 2`` after applying stage units and the prim's uniform world
        scale; converted widths and radii are in meters. Authored
        ``physics:masses`` take precedence over body mass or density, then
        material density. Density-derived mass uses
        ``physics:density * width**3``; converted masses are in kilograms.
        Without widths, it uses ``ModelBuilder.default_particle_radius`` and a
        support width of twice that radius. Non-uniform scale or shear is
        rejected because one scalar width cannot preserve a spherical particle
        under that transform.

        Visual meshes load or generate normals through :func:`newton.usd.get_mesh`.
        Sharp shading can duplicate vertices in :attr:`Model.shape_source`,
        including for untextured meshes. Collision-only loads do not request
        normals, and visual expansion preserves source mass properties. Use
        :func:`newton.usd.get_mesh` with ``load_normals=False`` when source
        vertex sharing is required for geometry processing.

        The returned mapping has the following entries:

        .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 75

            * - ``"fps"``
